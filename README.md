👋 Hi there! I'm Opel

💻 I'm passionate about building with ASP.NET (C#), Rust, OCaml, and Java. I enjoy solving backend challenges, crafting mobile apps, exploring UI/UX design, and diving into blockchain tech.

🚀 Currently exploring the depths of Python, Rust and OCaml—because why not love a little type safety and performance?

🤝 Always open to collaborations—especially on KYC and KYI (Know Your Industry) solutions for finance, health, tech, and everyday users.
